            <p>
                My kindergarten years at <b>Tabika Kemas Taman Anggerik 1 and Tabika Kemas Felda Tenggaroh 05 </b> were my first introduction to learning and discovery, filled with moments that would set the stage for my love of education and located conveniently near my house.

                    <p>At first, I felt nervous about the new situation. I had to adapt myself to the surroundings. However, over time I was able to get used to my teachers and friends. We were educated strictly and with high discipline. When the lessons started, we were forbidden to play or talk to each other. If we did, we would be fined.
                     Before going home, we are required to check the syllable reading every day. If there is a mistake in the syllable, my teacher will circle the word with a red marker, and I have to repeat it tomorrow. Unfortunately, I had to part ways with them because my family and I moved to Felda Tenggaroh 05 at age 6 due to family matters.

                    <p>The first time I stepped foot there, I was scared because of the surroundings. After arriving, I was requested to do a health exam first. After the health test, I was allowed to join the classroom. The learning environment here is more enjoyable and positive. This is because my teacher is less severe than before.
                     We will be rewarded if we act appropriately and answer questions correctly. This drives our classmates to compete for incentives every day.</p>

                    <p>Kindergarten was where I learned to make friends, share toys, and work as a teamâ€”important lessons that I still carry with me today.</p>
